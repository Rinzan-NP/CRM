## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+ and Pip
*   Node.js and npm
*   PostgreSQL database

### 1. Backend Setup (Server)

First, set up the Django server.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the server directory
cd Server

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the Server/ directory with your database credentials:
# Server/.env
DB_NAME=crm
DB_USER=your_postgres_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# 5. Apply database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# 6. Start the backend server
python manage.py runserver
```

The Django server will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Next, set up the React client.

```bash
# 1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory
cd Frontend

# 2. Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

The React development server will start, and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
