# Map Improvements Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Destination Marking Reset Issue
**Problem**: Blue destination markers were not resetting when switching between different maps or routes.

**Solution**: 
- Added unique `key` props to all GoogleMap components that include route-specific identifiers
- Updated marker keys to include route IDs and other relevant context
- Added useEffect hooks to reset selected locations when currentLocation changes

**Files Modified**:
- `Frontend/src/pages/RouteLiveTracker.jsx` - Added route-specific keys to map and markers
- `Frontend/src/components/Customers/MapLocationPicker.jsx` - Added location reset logic
- `Frontend/src/components/Customers/CustomerLocationMap.jsx` - Added customer-specific keys
- `Frontend/src/pages/RouteVisits.jsx` - Added edit mode specific keys

### 2. Road-Based Routing Implementation
**Problem**: Route lines were drawn as straight lines between points instead of following actual roads.

**Solution**:
- Created new `RoadRoutePolyline` component that uses Google Maps Directions API
- Implemented fallback to straight lines when Directions API fails
- Replaced all straight line polylines with road-following routes

**New Files Created**:
- `Frontend/src/components/Common/RoadRoutePolyline.jsx` - Road-based routing component

**Files Modified**:
- `Frontend/src/components/Common/GoogleMapWrapper.jsx` - Added DirectionsService and DirectionsRenderer exports
- `Frontend/src/pages/RouteLiveTracker.jsx` - Replaced Polyline with RoadRoutePolyline
- `Frontend/src/pages/RouteVisits.jsx` - Added RoadRoutePolyline import

## Technical Implementation Details

### RoadRoutePolyline Component
```javascript
// Features:
- Uses Google Maps Directions API for road-following routes
- Automatic fallback to straight lines if Directions API fails
- Configurable stroke color, opacity, and weight
- Handles multiple waypoints with proper routing
- Suppresses default markers to allow custom marker handling
```

### Key Props for Map Reset
```javascript
// RouteLiveTracker
key={`route-map-${selectedRouteId}`}

// RouteVisits  
key={`route-visits-map-${editMode ? editId : 'new'}`}

// MapLocationPicker
key={`location-picker-${selectedLocation?.lat}-${selectedLocation?.lng}`}

// CustomerLocationMap
key={`customer-map-${selectedCustomerId}-${customers.length}`}
```

### Marker Key Improvements
```javascript
// Planned route markers
key={`planned-visit-${selectedRouteId}-${visit.id}`}

// Actual route markers  
key={`actual-ping-${selectedRouteId}-${ping.id || index}`}

// Customer markers
key={`customer-${customer.id}-${selectedCustomerId}`}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Routes now follow actual roads instead of straight lines
2. **Accurate Distance Calculations**: Road-based routing provides more realistic distance estimates
3. **Proper Map Reset**: Markers and routes properly reset when switching between different views
4. **Fallback Support**: System gracefully falls back to straight lines if Directions API is unavailable
5. **Performance**: Unique keys ensure React properly manages component lifecycle

## Requirements

- Google Maps API Key with Directions API enabled
- Internet connection for Directions API calls
- React 16.8+ for hooks support

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. **Route Reset**: Switch between different routes in RouteLiveTracker - markers should reset properly
2. **Road Routing**: View routes in RouteLiveTracker - lines should follow roads instead of straight lines
3. **Location Picker**: Use MapLocationPicker - selected location should reset when switching contexts
4. **Customer Map**: Navigate between customers - markers should update correctly

## Notes

- The Directions API has usage limits and may incur costs depending on your Google Maps API plan
- Fallback to straight lines ensures the application works even if Directions API is unavailable
- All changes are backward compatible and don't break existing functionality
